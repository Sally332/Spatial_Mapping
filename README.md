# Spatial Transcriptomics of Breast Cancer and Lymph Node Metastases

This repository presents a spatial transcriptomics analysis of primary breast tumors and matched lymph node metastases (LNMT), integrating spatial gene expression with scRNA-seqâ€“derived gene programs to characterize tissue architecture and region-specific activity.

## Overview

- Program scoring using curated signatures: Epithelial, immune, stromal, proliferation
- Region annotation by top-quantile masking and label assignment
- Compact spatial visualizations
- Regionâ€“region adjacency and tissue-level composition analysis
- Differential expression between primary tumors and LNMT
- Interpretation

## Notes

The analysis is designed for interpretability, reproducibility, and communication of spatial tissue organization in cancer. Region-based annotation supports functional labeling of tissue compartments without relying on segmentation or clustering.
